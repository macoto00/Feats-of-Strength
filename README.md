# Feats-of-Strength ðŸ’ª

Personal milestones and achievements I want to share.

Programming evokes emotions in me - different and intense ones. Frustration, anger, and hopelessness when things don't go well, but it is precisely at that moment that it starts to get exciting. When you spend a huge amount of time on a problem and finally manage to solve it. Joy, excitement, and satisfaction come from overcoming the challenge and finding a solution. I believe there is a solution to everything. So let's apply it, find it, or invent it.

## ðŸš€ Get oriented and start 

I used to rush home from work. I wanted a job that I enjoy and that fulfills me. So, I left my job, learned to program, and got a job as a programmer. I did all this while burdened with a mortgage, supporting a family with two kids and a wife on maternity leave. Successfully. Now, I rush hapilly to work.

## ðŸš€ InteliJ IDEA Plugin

I programmed a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA in my free time that can generate a project structure in the form of a tree. It is freely available for download in the IDE's plugin tab. I was missing this feature, so I decided to create it myself.

## ðŸš€ StackOverflow - part of the crew, part of the boat

On my journey of learning, I too discovered the magic of StackOverflow. When I was stuck, I searched for solutions there and found them. That's why I decided to become a part of the community myself and contribute my knowledge to help solve others' problems.
